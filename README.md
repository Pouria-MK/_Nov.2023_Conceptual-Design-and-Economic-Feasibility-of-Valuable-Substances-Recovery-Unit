# Conceptual Design and Economic Feasibility of Valuable Substances Recovery Unit

## Overview

This project presents a comprehensive conceptual design and economic feasibility study of a plant designed to recover valuable substances from two input streams. The streams contain a mixture of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, hydrogen, methane, methanol, ethanol, water, and nitrogen. Through innovative process design and optimization, the project achieves recovery of valuable substances with an economic potential (EP) of nearly 90% of the theoretical maximum.

The study encompasses several key phases:

1. Conceptual design of the recovery process
2. Detailed process simulation using Aspen HYSYS
3. Economic analysis to determine the feasibility and profitability of the plant
4. Optimization of the recovery process to maximize economic potential

The project demonstrates the application of advanced chemical engineering principles, process simulation techniques, and economic analysis in the field of resource recovery and utilization.

This project showcases advanced capabilities in process design, simulation, and economic analysis of complex chemical engineering systems, demonstrating proficiency in industry-standard tools and methodologies.
